# Article Summarization from URL

Article Summarization from URL is a project that extracts text from a given URL, summarizes it using language generation techniques, and converts the summary into audio format. It leverages LangChain API and Hugging Face models to perform text summarization and text-to-speech conversion.

## How it Works

1. **URL Extraction**: The project extracts text content from a provided URL using LangChain's UnstructuredURLLoader.
2. **Summarization**: The extracted text serves as input for the summarization model. It uses the Conversational Summarization model from Hugging Face to generate a concise summary.
3. **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: The generated summary is converted into audio format using the gTTS library, providing users with an audio version of the summary.

## Usage

To use the Article Summarization from URL:

1. Visit the project's website: [Article Summarization](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Mr-Vicky-01/Article_Summarization_from_URL)
2. Enter the URL of the article you want to summarize and convert to audio.
3. Wait for the system to process the URL, generate a summary, and produce an audio file.
4. Listen to the audio summary generated by the system.
